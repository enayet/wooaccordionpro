Yes! WooAccordion Pro works with any properly coded WordPress theme that supports WooCommerce. We've tested it with 50+ popular themes including Storefront, Astra, OceanWP, and Divi.

Absolutely! The plugin includes extensive styling options, multiple pre-designed templates, and supports custom CSS for complete design control.

Your content is preserved exactly as it was. The plugin simply changes how it's displayed - from horizontal tabs to vertical accordions. You can easily switch back by disabling the plugin.

= Does it work with variable products? =
Yes, accordions work perfectly with variable products, grouped products, and all WooCommerce product types.

Yes! The custom tab manager lets you create unlimited accordion sections with rich content, conditional display logic, and priority ordering.
